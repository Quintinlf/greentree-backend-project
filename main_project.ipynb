    "## 🎯 Objective\n",
    "Build a **Django-based backend system** that demonstrates your understanding of:\n",
    "- **Modeling data** using Django ORM\n",
    "- **Creating RESTful API endpoints** with Django REST Framework (DRF)\n",
    "- **Documenting APIs** using Swagger (via `drf-yasg`)\n",
    "- **Optional:** generating basic data visualizations\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Django Models\n",
    "Define database models that represent real data (e.g., *Deals*, *Contacts*, or *Extraction Records*).  \n",
    "Each model should:\n",
    "- Store meaningful, structured information  \n",
    "- Support create, read, update, and delete operations  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. API Endpoints\n",
    "Create API routes that:\n",
    "- Interact with your models  \n",
    "- Return JSON responses  \n",
    "- Handle both GET and POST requests  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Swagger Documentation\n",
    "Integrate Swagger UI so your endpoints can be explored and tested visually at:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. (Optional) Data Visualization\n",
    "If you have time, add an endpoint that returns or renders simple visual data — e.g., a summary of entries or frequency of extracted data.\n",
